## Note
1. This file contains something that is suddenly flashed through my brain.
2. So, what's in this file sometimes means nothing.

## List
* [x] change vundle to neobundle
    > neobundle needs unite for async in neovim

* [x] fix the error that when switching modes especially switching into insert
    mode from normal mode by typing "i", the cursor may move forward, which is
    quite annoying. And even in normal mode, type "x" somewhere in a text, the
    next character may be deleted.

* [ ] replace nerdtree with vimfiler

* [ ] split plugins into groups

* [ ] replace airline with flagship

* [ ] add devicons

* [ ] optimize base nvim settings

* [ ] reveal more good plugins and use neovim more often.
