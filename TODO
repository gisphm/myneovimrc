Note: This file contains something that is suddenly flashed through my brain.
      So, what' s in this file does not mean anything at all sometimes.

1 - change vundle to neobundle.

2 - fix the error that when switching modes especially switching into insert
    mode from normal mode by typing "i", the cursor may move forward, which is
    quite annoying. And even in normal mode, type "x" somewhere in a text, the
    next character may be deleted.
